## Go have fun with tech, tools, and life.

Hello and welcome to the GOFUNWITH blog!

This isn't just another space for listing the latest gadgets or explaining complex code. We are oriented towards **'experience-first, challenge and experimentation, and joyful creation'** rather than being **'tech-centric'**.

### Our Philosophy

Our core brand value is "Go have fun with tech, tools, and life."

* **Experience-First:** We get hands-on with tech, DIY, camping, automation, and various life experiments.
* **Journey and Experiment:** We value the joy found in the process itself just as much as the final result. Even failure is part of the fun journey.
* **Ending in Fun:** While we cover in-depth topics with a professional mindset, we aim for a brand where all creation and experimentation concludes with 'fun'.

This blog itself is a product of automation experiments using tools like GitHub Pages, Jekyll, Cloudflare, and n8n. We look forward to sharing the experience of building this blog with you.

Come have fun with tech, tools, and life with GOFUNWITH!
